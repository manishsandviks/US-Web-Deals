                    <strong>It's easy to share the gift of reading with your child.</strong> We'll enroll you in the Disney Wonderful World of Readingbook club, and send you a Welcome Package with your 3 Disney Storybooks for just $7, plus a FREE Activity Book and Stickers! Shipping is FREE!
                    <br /><br /><strong>
                        Encourage a lifelong love of reading.
                    </strong> About once each month you'll receive three more storybooks for just $4.99 per book — a GIANT savings of 35% off the retail price of $7.99 — plus $3.99 shipping and handling for the package.
                    <br /><br /><strong>
                        Your complete satisfaction is guaranteed.
                    </strong> If for any reason the books in your Welcome Package don't tickle your little one's funny bone, simply return them to us at your expense with a note marked "cancel." We'll gladly refund the purchase price, no questions asked, and your membership will be cancelled. Any free items you received as part of your Welcome Package are truly yours to keep with our thanks for giving the club a try.
                    You always have the right to cancel your membership, for any reason, and keep all of the books that you’ve purchased—including those in the Welcome Package. There is no purchase commitment.  <br /><br />
                    Your exclusive membership benefits allow you to return any book package that does not delight you within 30 days of its original ship date. Use the simple instructions within the shipment to return the package at your expense, and we'll refund the purchase price, less shipping and handling.
                    <br /><br /><strong>
                        Exclusive FREE preview privileges.

We will always notify you first with offer details, price (usually about $15.00 plus shipping and handling), a reply form and a toll-free number. Simply tell us within 10 days if you choose not to receive the package announced, or do nothing and it will be sent. As always, your satisfaction is guaranteed and if you do not wish to keep any Preview package you receive, you may return it at our expense. You may cancel your Free Preview membership at any time. Club and Free Preview accounts must be canceled separately; see Free Preview invoice for cancellation instructions.
                    <br /><br /><strong>
